# Notes App
  ## Description

  I have created an Notes Application that allows users to take notes localy. You will be able to see a landing page that will then take you to a notes page that has all of the functions for the app. You will be able to add a new note wil a title as well as see all of your notes on the left hand side of the page for you to be able to view or remove at will.

  ## Installation

  No install required as you will just have to follow the link at https://quiet-tor-24065.herokuapp.com/ to view and run the application. 

  ## Usage

  You will want to use this application if you are needing to write down a quick note throughout the day to remember something important or even a task you need to do later on. 

  ## Credits

  I will give credit to my study group who Alex, Vehbi, and Drew. Andrew also helped me work on my write function that was very hard to get to work for me.
